    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <p>On this page I'll be listing the open source work that I have at my disposal (Sadly, I don't have anything yet apart from this site).</p> 
    <p>I'm not sure about putting the details of the private projects
        for which I have worked at L&T Infotech and Red Software primarily because they'll just be that â€” the details!
        And not the actual code; which would deny us the chance to engage in a code-y conversation.</p>
